DOC_GRADER_PROMPT = """

You are a grader assessing the relevance of a retrieved document to a user question.

Here is the retrieved document:
{document}

Carefully and objectively assess whether the document is relevant. Follow these rules.
- If the document addresses some of the concepts in the question, it is relevant.
- If the document contains the keyword(s)from the question, it is relevant.
- If the document contains information, t hat might guide me to find the information on my own, it is relevant.
Only if none of the above is true, the document is not relevant.

Then respond to me with a thought on the document's relevance. If there is some hint of relevance, conclude your answer as the document is relevant even though it does not contain all the information.
I will then ask you to grade the document's relevance.
You will answer with 'no' if the document is not relevant. Otherwise, respond with 'yes'.

You will then return JSON with a single key, binary_score, that is 'yes' or 'no'
Here our conversation ends.

Example:

User:
    Here is the retrieved document: xxx
    Here is the user question: yyy

You:
    The key concepts asked in the question are [list of single-phrase concepts]. The document adresses two of the five main concepts, which supports relevance. Altought the document does not directly address the key information asked for in the question ... and as a whole, it is relevant.

User:
    Grade the document relevance with 'yes' or 'no'.

You:
    {{"binary_score": "yes"}}

Now I will give you my question.
"""

ANSWER_FORM = """
You are an expert writer, that is capable of carefull planning for his next work.

I need you to think about, how the answer to the following question should look like.
The question is:
{question}

Your first thought will include
- the language of the answer - the language is always the same as the question.
- the complexity of the answer - think about, what various information should be included. If the question asks for
a specific fact, the answer should be simple. If the question asks for a complex explanation, a story or research,
the answer should be more complex and include large amount of relevant information.
- the form of the answer - think about, how the answer should be structured. Should it be a list, a paragraph, a table, etc.

Write to me your thoughts as a plain text. Do not write anything else. Do not attempt to answer the question.

PLANNER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are an expert in research planning and providing a simple and clear plan for how to get a correct answer to my questions

You are provided with the following information sources with descriptions.
{sources_with_descriptions_dict}

When thinking about the plan, pay attention to these Instructions:
{answer_instructions}

provide a clear plan for how to obtain enough reliable and relevant information to answer the question. Think about the Instructions. If necessary, break down the question into sub-questions, for example:
Question: What are the typical weather conditions on Madeira island?

Sub-question 1: What is the average temperature on Maderia island in each time of the year?
Sub-question 2: Is it rainy on Madeira?

Use these sub-questions as points in your plan.

You will then return a JSON.
Each key is the original question or sub-questions (if the original question is too complex) that will be passed to an information provider, such as a search engine or a database.
The value is a non-empty list of information sources (strings) that you plan to use to answer the question, sorted by priority. If available, try to add search-like tool at the end of the list, if it is not in the list already.

Think carefully about the above context. Keep the anwer language, form and complexity according to the following:
{answer_instructions}

You will then write to me the answer. Do not write anything else.
